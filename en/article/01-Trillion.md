August 15, 1977 was a day for human beings to commemorate. The Pan-Galactic Union and human beings made the first contact. The problem is that humans can not understand pan-galactic language. So, according to Chomsky's generative grammar, humans sent 42 babies with their families to the headquarters of the Pan-Galactic Union, the Sombrero Galaxy. The baby learns the words of the land where he grew up. Therefore, they are expected to learn Pan-Galactic and return home.

The babies and their families boarded the Pan-Galactic Union spacecraft and departed from the base built on Jupiter's satellite Europa to the Sombrero Galaxy. Twenty years later, they returned to Earth with pan-galactic language teachers. Humans learned pan-galactic language. No, humans have not been able to speak properly after six years of studying Pan-Galactic. How many people have become able to speak pan-galactic language? Maybe less than 10%. There are two main reasons why humans can not speak Pan-Galactic. 1, There are few people on the earth who can speak pan-galactic language well. 2. Humans do not feel the need to learn the language because they do not need to speak Pan-Galactic in Earth.

"Ah," the turtle interrupted your story. "I have difficulty understanding your story because your breath is long."

You said to the turtle, "I intend to speak as usual."

"It was troubled," said Turtle. "As you see, I am smaller than you, so I am more sad than you. So you need to explain as I understand."

"What should I do?"

The turtle said, "It is not difficult for me to keep track of an item. What is the main point of your story?"

You said, "The core of my story is the history of the universal translator introduced to the earth."

The turtle said, "Where is the most remarkable part of its history?"

"Hmmm," you said after thinking, "It would be an argument made by Graham, who introduced universal translators to humans, probably."

The turtle who heard it said, "Please talk about that," you were dissatisfied. "There are various foreheads leading up to that argument. Without that story, the appeal of the story can not be fully transmitted."

The turtle blinked and said, "Yes, and I will forget everything."

You had the desire to finger the turtle's head. What a sassy turtle.

Graham studied pan-galactic language in the sombrero galaxy and returned to earth with a universal translator. She used a universal translator in front of an expert. The expert asked a question because Graham's speech was unusual.

"Your words are quite different from our daily conversations."

Graham replied, "The number of Earthlings is considerably less than the number of people using Pan-Galactic language. We translate our wording because universal translators have poor translation accuracy for rare languages. is needed."

One of the experts said, "How many Pan-Galactic speakers do you have?"

Graham replied, "The Pan-Galactic Union reported last year that there were 184467447379551616 speakers of Pan-Galactic."

One of the experts said, "Too many digit figures."

Another expert said, "180,000 trillion people."

Another expert said, "Dr. Graham, if all the Earthers use the translator properly, all Pan Galactic translators will go bankrupt."

Graham said, "Don't worry. You will need more programmers as computer technology evolves. You will need more statisticians as statistical technology evolves. Likewise, a universal translator As more people use it, they will need more Pan Galactic translators. "

Another expert said, "Machine-directed language distorts our linguistic culture."

Graham said, "Yes. Do you know the word 'MARAMIKHU?' "

None of the experts knew the word.

"It means the world of dreams, and the world after death. MARAMIKHU does not distinguish between dreams and death. This word was used in the Andaman Islands of India. But this word is not used now. This is because the speakers of this language are extinct, and if we are afraid of language change and ignore our cultural transmission, our language and culture will eventually follow the same fate as MARAMIKHU. "

"Well," the turtle cut off your story, "I want to know the consequences of the argument. Have humans started to use universal translators?"

You said, "No, a universal translator is considered an imperfect device, and humans have sent a request to the Pan-Galactic Union to improve the program."

The turtle said, "What happened with that?"

You said, "The Pan-Galactic Union rejected the request."

"why?"

"A civilization that has developed enough to use a universal translator will collapse before the Pan-Galactic Union finishes its program improvements."
