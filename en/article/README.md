# Galactic Edge

After a vast journey, you arrived at the base of Jupitor's satellite Europa. When you open the base door, a turtle on the desk welcomes you.

The turtle said, "It's unusual to see a customer. Is it for something?"

You ask the turtle about the purpose of coming to this facility, that is, a universal translator.

"Oh ..." The turtle heard that, and withdrew her head to her body. "There is a problem with the translator."

"What's wrong? Whatever the problem is, I need the translator," you said. "I have to go to the sombrero galaxy and get an intergalactic passport."

The turtle stretches out and says, "Hmm, the problem is not with the machine but with your wording."

"My wording?" You said.

"Yes," said the turtle. "As you know, your language is quite different from 'pan-galactic', so you have to change the wording to match the translator."

"What can I do to help me speak the right language for my translator? ... Oops"

The turtle was about to fall from the desk, so you crawled, grabbed it, and returned it to its original location.

"Thank you."

The turtle thanked you. "So ... yes, wording."

The turtle scratched her forefoot. The screen then displayed a letter that you could read.

1.  Clear core message
    -   What are you trying to convey? Request? Criticism? Or praise? In any case, the clearer the content, the more accurate the translation.
2.  What is the subject of the sentence?
    -   Clarifying the subject of the sentence improves the translation accuracy.
3.  Use punctuation properly
    -   Proper use of punctuation and simplification of the sentence structure will improve translation accuracy.

...

"Wait," you yelled. "How many advice do you have?"

The turtle said, "In your case, there are 32767 items."

"What a thing," you screamed. "I understand the problem with universal translators. It takes a lot of training to use this tool."

"That's right," the turtle said, turning off the screen. "That is ..."

"Okay, I will learn the appropriate language for translators," you tapped your chest.

"Hmmm?" Your words surprised the turtle to stretch more than it could.

"I know that the human brain is flexible and adaptable. Besides, I can not wait until the universal translator is completed. There are other reasons ..."

"Uh," the turtle interrupted your story. "There are likely to be about 32767 items for which you try to acquire techniques suitable for translators."

The turtle scratched her forefoot again. Then a round hole was opened on the desk and a small chip appeared.

The turtle looked at you and said, "Please insert this chip into your terminal. Then the translator will be available soon."

"Thank you." You said thank you to the turtle, insert the chip into the handset, and said, "By the way you said customers are rare, right?"

"Yes. Other customers will not visit for a while."

When you heard that you smiled and said, "I need training on a translator. So, let me tell you some stories I know?"

The turtle was surprised again and stretched her neck.

<br>

For this reason, several stories, via translators, begin.
